# OpenOOD: Benchmarking Generalized OOD Detection

This repository includes representative methods within the `Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection Framework` that proposed
in [our survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11334).

Topics of anomaly detection, novelty detection, open set recognition,
and out-of-distribution detection
are within the scope of this codebase.

This codebase is still under construction. Comments, issues, and contributions are all welcomed!

## Updates
- **12 April, 2022**: Primary release to support Full-Spectrum OOD Detection.

## Get Started

The easiest hands-on script is to train LeNet on MNIST and evaluate its OOD or FS-OOD performance with MSP baseline.
```bash
sh scripts/0_basics/mnist_train.sh
sh scripts/c_ood/0_mnist_test_ood_msp.sh
sh scripts/c_ood/0_mnist_test_fsood_msp.sh
```


[Tutorials](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD/wiki) on understanding and contributing the codebase are provided in our wiki pages.

## Supported Methods
This part lists all the methods we reproduced in this codebase.
Organization/Indexing follows the structure of [our survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11334).
