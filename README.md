# OpenOOD: Benchmarking Generalized OOD Detection

This repository includes representative methods within the `Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection Framework` that proposed
in [our survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11334).

Topics of anomaly detection, novelty detection, open set recognition,
and out-of-distribution detection
are within the scope of this codebase.

## Get Started

The easiest hands-on script is to train LeNet on MNIST.
```bash
sh scripts/_get_started/0_mnist_train.sh
```
Tutorials on understanding and contributing the codebase are provided in our documentation.

## Supported Methods
This part lists all the methods we reproduced in this codebase.
Organization/Indexing follows the structure of [our survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11334).
Results and models are available in the [model zoo](docs/model_zoo.md).
